// in particular, if you want to use the fake RTC and the time picker, be aware that setting the wall clock messes up 
// the link between fake RTC time, and the time of day shown by the overworld day/night blend. 
// In my hack I avoid setting the wall clock altogether because the player can just set the time of day via the select menu, 
// and I have removed the wall clock auto-set from the debug menu action in my project to avoid setting it up accidentally when developing.
// But there should definitely be a way to set up the fake RTC and wall clock properly with the overworld day/night cycle,
// I just never wrapped my head around it. the time waiting functions and AccurateTimeOfDay function are coherent with each other when using Fake RTC and this time-picker, 
// which is what matters most for gameplay purposes.
